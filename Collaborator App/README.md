## Overview:
Collaboration is based on [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/): a free web based application that finds the best times for a group to meet that is simple and easy to use. I used when2meet frequently as a student, but oftentimes would feel frustrated with certain features on the application. Even with such a basic concept, a good, user friendly, and free scheduling application is hard to come by. With my appreciation of when2meet, I wanted to see if I could take all the great aspects of when2meet, learn the pain points, and then create an app that encompasses those great aspects and new suggestions. This is where I developed a design for Collaboration.

## Process:
***DMAD 501 Course***

1. Analyzing applications through ease of use and overall experience
2. User interview (creating a user interview field guide, finding participants, conduct interviews, user notes, etc)
3. Synthesize Research
4. [Reasearch Findings Deck](https://github.com/tiffanyai/UX-Design-and-Research-Portfolio/blob/main/Collaborator/Research%20Findings%20Deck%20.pdf)
5. Create User Persona
6. User Journey Map


***DMAD 503 Course***

7. Narrowing down a specific feature to design
8. Research analogous Features 
9. User Stories
10. Task Flow Diagrams
11. [Idea Sketching](https://github.com/tiffanyai/UX-Design-and-Research-Portfolio/blob/main/Collaborator/Ideation%20for%20Collaborator%20Process/Idea%20Sketching.pdf)

## App Concept:
DMAD 501 was the research and foundation part of building Collaboration. This consisted of research, user testing, and finding areas of improvement for the app implementation. DMAD 503 was where the design build came to play. I wanted to first focus on the initial stage of the meeting coordinator creating a meeting title, timezone, description, days available, timeframe, and participants so that the next stage of the meeting creation process can commence. I implemented:

1. **Dasboard:** This is where the user can see all of their meetings for the day/week/month in one location. It will take new meetings/events from other platforms (you will login through the app to those different platforms so Collaboration can have access to the other platforms (ex. Google Calendar, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc) so that you can synch all meetings into one location. From there you can access many different features; mainly the "new meenting" feature

      The user can color coordinate the meetings to whatever they like (ex. green = school meetings, brown = casual friend hangouts)

2. **New Meeting:** This is where you input the title, timezone, and description. The issue with when2meet (as many interviewees stated) was that it was a great concept, but there was too many to choose from and was also confusing. With collaboration, it will use the IP Address or Phone OS to auto produce your timezone (along with requiring the user to double check if it is done correctly).
3. **Pick day(s) available:** The meeting coordinator then picks the days they want the participants to input their availabilities for
4. **Pick timeframe:** The meeting coordinator will input their time availabilities through click and drag. The click and drag was an issue in when2meet because it was too small to see what you dragged on the website. However, it is much easier to see on a phone. Additionally, as you drag a timeframe that you dragged between will show up on the inputted availabilities so that you can edit it if you made a mistake.
5. **Choose participants:** The app will suggest recent users who you've had meetings with along with people on your contacts who are on the app. You can also search through email if they don't have an application so that they can receive an email to create an account after you send in your availabilities.
6. **Summary:** This is where the meeting coordinator can check all their input and edit if they please. They can also pick the platform they want to use for their video meeting (as they linked the different platforms previously). There's also a feature that will remind people who haven't inputted times every ___ days so that it takes the resposibility off the meeting coordinator to remind participants to put in their times.

The next steps of implementations include: participants inputting their times, the app compiling overlapping times, the app confirming with meeting coordinator, and then the app sending out meeting date, time, and details.
