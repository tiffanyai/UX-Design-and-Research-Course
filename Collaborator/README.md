## Overview:
Collaboration is based on [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/): a free web based application that finds the best times for a group to meet that is simple and easy to use. Even with such a basic concept, a good, user friendly, and free scheduling application is hard to come by. With my appreciation of when2meet, I wanted to see if I could take all the great aspects of when2meet, learn the pain points, and then create an app that encompases those great aspects and new suggestions. This is where I developed a design for Collaboration.

## Process:
***DMAD 501***
1. Analyzing applications through ease of use and overall experience
2. User interview (creating a user interview field guide, finding participants, conduct interviews, user notes, etc)
3. Synthesize Research
4. [Reasearch Findings Deck](https://github.com/tiffanyai/UX-Design-and-Research-Portfolio/blob/main/Collaborator/Research%20Findings%20Deck%20.pdf)
5. Create User Persona
6. User Journey Map

***DMAD 503***
7. Narrowing down a specific feature to design
8. Research analogous Features 
9. User Stories
10. Task Flow Diagrams
11. [Idea Sketching](https://github.com/tiffanyai/UX-Design-and-Research-Portfolio/blob/main/Collaborator/Ideation%20for%20Collaborator%20Process/Idea%20Sketching.pdf)
