## Overview:
Collaboration is based on [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/): a free web based application that finds the best times for a group to meet that is simple and easy to use. Even with such a basic concept, a good, user friendly, and free scheduling application is hard to come by. With my appreciation of when2meet, I wanted to see if I could take all the great aspects of when2meet, learn the pain points, and then create an app that encompases those great aspects and new suggestions. This is where I developed a design for Collaboration.
