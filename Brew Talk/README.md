## Overview: 
Brew Talk is an app I designed based on months of research, user testing, and concept ideation techniques. Through input from student coffee lovers, I uncovered that coffee does not represent just a drink for people to stay awake. Cafes and coffee encapsulates a place for: socilization, solitude, study, relaxation, aesthetics, different aromas, and much more.

## App Concept:
This app is meant to create an "at home cafe experience". Many interviewees voiced their love of cafes, however their concern for how expensive it is and how inefficient it is to go there. With Brew Talk, there are many different features that emulate the cafe experience:

- Personalized monthly coffee delivery system 
  - Including a quiz to personalize type, description, origin information, etc.
- Coffee recipe based on current months coffee 
  - Along with user recipe forums to encourage a sense of community
- Cafe ambiance to emulate being at the cafe 
  - ex. type of music, coffee cup, coffee maker, etc
- View "Study Buddy Schedule" to setup or preview appointments
  - **Study Buddy** is a system that allows you to study with someone (for people who enjoy the company of others when studying -- that they usually do at cafes)
- View different types of people that are active to set up a Study Buddy call
